# Basic React Scaffold

## System Dependencies:
Before you get up and running make sure to have:
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (optional)

## Install

To install project dependencies, start up the best terminal on your machine and do:

```
npm install
```

__Using Yarn instead__

[Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) is an alterntive package manager that offers great performance and predictability.  If you'd like to install dependencies using Yarn, do:

```
yarn
```

### Development
Use these commands to develop a local copy of the scaffold.

Command | Description
--- | ---
`npm start` | Will start a local server at `http://localhost:8080`
`npm run test` | Runs Jest
`npm run test:watch` | Runs the test runner in watch mode.
`npm run build` | Runs webpack to config for production.

### What is this?

It is just my personal scaffold for creating a front end with React/Redux.
